# Monopoly

Monopoly is a fun and interactive web-based game inspired by the classic board game, but with a unique twist. It uses popular Purdue University residence halls as properties, creating a familiar and engaging experience for students and alumni alike.

Throughout development, I faced significant hurdles in integrating JavaScript with various libraries, establishing smooth animations, and finding the right balance between functionality and aesthetics. Overcoming these obstacles required a deep dive into CSS animations, JavaScript event handling, and the intricacies of responsive design. Thanks to the invaluable support from communities like Stack Overflow and thorough documentation, I not only surmounted these challenges but also honed my skills in web development significantly.
